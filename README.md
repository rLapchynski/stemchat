This is a basic chat server written in node.js that I wrote to mess around with node.js and other web dev stuff. It was never intended to be a complete project, or have ongoing development. I'm not even quite sure why I put it on GitHub. So if you choose to read this code, do so at your own peril, as it's not documented at all and was writen by a high-school me with only a rudimentary knowledge of node.js, a few hours of free time, and entirely live updates. Don't look directly at it or you may end up thinking PHP was a good idea.
